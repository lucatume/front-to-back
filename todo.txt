What's this to do?

- the plugin eschews the use of a theme and should be pointed to a templates folder with a setting
- the plugin packs cmb2
- the plugin was inspired by Perch in its functions
- when the user creates a page in WP admin then a new file is created in the templates folder (e.g. `page-slug.php`)
- this is a plain php file that's in fact a copy of the `master.php` file
- the plugin will require the user to add a master page in the templates folder to work
- when the user reloads a page edit screen the corresponding template file will be read
- if the corresponding template file is missing a new copy will be made of the `master.php` file
- when the whole php template file has been read then the plugin will check for `ftb-*` tags (e.g. `<ftb-content ...`)
- each ftb content should specify
    - an id that will map to a post meta key
    - a type that will map to one of cmb2 field types
    - a title that will be the title of the cmb2 field
    - more optionals (to be decided)
- the flow when encountering an `ftb-` tag is as follows:
    - check the field has the minimum required fields else throw
    - the meta, type and title information will be added to the list of meta fields to show on that specific post edit screen
    - the way this happens is by reading that information from the template file and storing it in the database to then associate the meta to the post using cmb2 calls
    - Defaults should be provided for each field
- after the whole template has been parsed a first version of it is rendered using the information in the defaulted meta fields
    - replace each `<ftb-` tag with the corresponding meta value like this:
        - `<p><ftp id='author-name' type='text' title='Author name'></p>` will become
        - `<p>Some text<p>`
- when all of the replacements have been made the page rendered php and an hashed version of it are stored in the database
- the admin page edit screen will show up with the meta fields added
- when the user changes any meta for the page in the backed the page php is re-built and stored in the database
- visitors will be served the page php stored in the database
- the plugin should allow for inheritance ~ using a well crafted master page?

Todo:
+ the plugin packs cmb2
+ the plugin adds a setting to specify the templates folder location relative to the wp `ABSPATH`
+ the plugin checks and requires a `master.php` file in said folder
+ the plugin creates a new `page-slug.php` file when a page is created in WP admin
- if `page-slug.php` file is missing then the plugin re-creates it as a copy of `master.php`
- the plugin reads the meta fields backward
